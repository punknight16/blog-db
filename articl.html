The things that impress me are small -- like having greeting cards at hand for an unexpected birthday or ribs in the fridge that are ready to be cooked up just in case people come over. Since marrying Lauren, I’m beginning to understand that this preparedness is planned. Some people spend a lot of time organizing their lives, so they can be ready for not so unexpected circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>The habit of being organized is called conscientiousness under the big five personality test. Highly conscientious people are reliable, so they don’t miss meetings often, and they like to prepare for many scenarios so mishaps don’t become big mistakes. On the opposite side of the spectrum are “easy-going” people. Life doesn’t need to be as planned, and things will work themselves out.</p><p><br></p><p>Lately, I’ve been trying to study how opportunities manifest themselves for both types of people. A highly conscientious person is aware of the opportunities that are available, and attacks those opportunities with 100% of their will. A more easy going person might offer help here and there, and be offered opportunities in return. As far as I can tell, both ways work, but I think certain ways work better for certain types of people.</p></div>
